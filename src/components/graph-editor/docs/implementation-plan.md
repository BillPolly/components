# Graph Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Graph Editor component following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Each feature will be implemented by first writing tests that define the expected behavior, then implementing the minimum code necessary to make those tests pass.

### Approach

1. **Test First**: Write failing tests that define the expected behavior
2. **Implement**: Write the minimum code to make tests pass
3. **Verify**: Ensure all tests pass and behavior is correct
4. **Move Forward**: Proceed to the next feature (no refactoring step for MVP)

### Rules

- All tests must be written before implementation
- Each phase must be completed before moving to the next
- Integration tests verify component interactions
- Unit tests verify individual class behavior
- All tests must pass before marking a step complete
- Reference design.md for implementation details
- Focus on functional correctness only (no performance/security for MVP)
