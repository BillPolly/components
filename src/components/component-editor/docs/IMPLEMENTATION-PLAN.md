# Component Editor - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the refactor step - we aim to get the implementation correct on the first attempt. The plan is organized into phases that build upon each other, with each phase delivering demonstrable, working functionality.

**Current Status: Phase 8 Complete - 500 tests passing**
- Phase 8.3: 12 tests for component browser filtering
- Phase 8.4: 5 integration tests for filtering workflow
- Phase 8.5: 5 tests for actor framework WebSocket communication

## Implementation Rules

### Testing Principles
- **TDD WITHOUT REFACTOR** - Write tests first, implement to pass tests, move to next feature
- **NO MOCKS in integration tests** - All integration tests use real components, real DOM, real Actors, real DataStores
- **NO MOCKS in implementation code** - Implementation must not contain any mock or fallback implementations
- **NO FALLBACKS** - All errors must be raised immediately, no graceful degradation in implementation code
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - Both unit tests and integration tests for all functionality
- **100% test pass rate** - All tests must pass before moving to next phase

### Quality Standards
- **Functional correctness ONLY** - Focus on MVP functionality, ignore NFRs (security, performance, scalability)
- **Local running and UAT** - No publishing, deployment, or migration concerns
- **Fail fast** - Raise errors immediately, no silent failures or fallback behavior
- **Real component integration** - Integration tests use actual DOM rendering, actual Actors, actual persistence

### Development Approach
- **Each phase must be completed fully before moving to next phase**
- **All tests for a phase must pass before proceeding**
- **First step of each phase: Reread DESIGN.md** - Ensure understanding of architecture before implementation
- **Implementation follows design document specifications exactly**
- **No deviation from architectural principles defined in design**

**Goal:** Demonstrate CORRECT actor testing pattern using MockWebSocket

**Status:** COMPLETED - 5 tests passing (ComponentStore.websocket.test.js)

**Critical Learning:** Direct actor wiring bypasses WebSocket layer and gives false confidence!

**❌ WRONG Pattern (What NOT to do):**
```javascript
// This bypasses WebSocket, JSON serialization, routing - tests pass but real browser fails!
const result = await serverActor.receive('component.create', data);
```

**✅ CORRECT Pattern (Using MockWebSocket):**
```javascript
// Create paired WebSockets - THE CORRECT PATTERN!
const { serverWs, clientWs } = MockWebSocket.createPair();

// Server handles incoming WebSocket messages
serverWs.addEventListener('message', async (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);  // Real JSON deserialization
  const result = await serverActor.receive(message.messageType, message.data);
  serverWs.send(JSON.stringify({ result }));  // Real JSON serialization
});

// Client sends via WebSocket (serialized as JSON)
clientWs.send(JSON.stringify({ messageType: 'component.create', data }));
```

**What This Tests:**
- ✅ WebSocket connection layer
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Message routing through WebSocket
- ✅ Complex data structure preservation
- ✅ Special character handling
- ✅ Error handling in WebSocket layer

**Implementation Steps:**

- [✅] Write documentation test explaining why direct actor wiring is wrong
- [✅] Verify all 5 WebSocket tests pass
- [✅] Verify full regression - all 500 tests passing (495 original + 5 WebSocket)

**Key Files Created:**
- `test/components/component-editor/ComponentStore.websocket.test.js` - Demonstrates correct actor testing pattern

**Documentation Reference:**
- `/packages/cli/__tests__/TESTING-NOTES.md` - Explains why direct actor wiring is wrong
- `/packages/shared/actor-testing/README.md` - Actor testing infrastructure
- `/packages/shared/actor-testing/src/mocks/MockWebSocket.js` - MockWebSocket implementation
